### context

### task

Turn the current uv-specific instructions into a first-class `codebenchmark` CLI that works via `pip install` / `$ codebenchmark …` without extra wrappers.

### analysis

- The repo currently assumes contributors use `uv run codebenchmark ...` (README.md lines 1-58). That works locally because `uv` injects the entry point into a temporary venv, but it fails for anyone who expects a globally available `$ codebenchmark` binary after `pip install .` or `pipx install .`.
- Although `pyproject.toml` defines `[project.scripts] codebenchmark = "codebenchmark.cli:app"`, we never distribute an installable artifact or document how to install it (no `pip install .`/`pipx install .` guidance). Users following README instructions therefore only see the uv-based workflow.
- There is no platform-friendly launcher script or `pipx run` example, so even though the entry point exists, the docs effectively hide it behind uv. We need to ensure install instructions produce the `$ codebenchmark` command and adjust docs/examples accordingly.

### fix_plan

- Update README.md and docs/cmd_tool.md to include installation instructions that produce the `codebenchmark` executable (e.g., `pipx install .` / `pip install .` / `uv tool install`). Show sample invocations using `$ codebenchmark …`.
- Provide a helper script/Makefile target or a short section in docs describing how to expose the CLI globally (e.g., `uv run --package codewikibench codebenchmark --help` or `pipx install .`).
- Verify packaging works (`pip install .` -> `codebenchmark --help`) and document any prerequisites.
