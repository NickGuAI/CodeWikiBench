### instructions

If mode is `plan`:
-   Review the provided @task under given @context, write @analysis for the rootcause of the problem, and @fix_plan to resolve the problem. Add all relevant files to the @related_files section. Update this document at the end.

If mode is `execute`:
-   If the @fix_plan is not provided, ask the user for confirmation.
-   Execute the @fix_plan.

### context

Readme and src/ code includes instructions for original docs.
This does not apply for most repos.

### task

Remove instructions for original docs from readme and src/ code.

### analysis

- README previously opened with "Official Documentation" instructions that required cloning/pulling the upstream repo into `data/<repo>/original`. Most benchmark repos only ship DeepWiki or CodeWiki dumps, so those steps confuse operators and don't match reality.
- `run_rubrics_pipeline.sh` defaulted to `original/`, printed copy suggesting docs always live there, and failed early if that folder didn't exist—even if `deepwiki/` or `codewiki/` was present. `generate_rubrics.py` mirrored that assumption.
- `run_evaluation_pipeline.sh`, `judge/judge.py`, and helper scripts referenced `original` in usage text or defaults, forcing users to pass overrides constantly. Some CLI tools (e.g., `download_github_folder.sh`) even hard-coded the destination to `../data/<repo>/original`.
- These instructions/assumptions collectively implied `original/` documentation was mandatory.

### fix_plan

1. Rewrite the README parsing section to focus on DeepWiki/CodeWiki flows and describe the new auto-detection behavior instead of telling people to fetch "original" docs.
2. Update rubrics/evaluation pipelines (shell + Python) to auto-detect any parsed docs folder containing `docs_tree.json`, while still allowing manual overrides via `--docs-source`/`--reference`.
3. Remove vestigial references to `original/` in helper scripts (e.g., `download_github_folder.sh`, `assess_rubrics.py`) or make them configurable so instructions no longer single out the `original` folder.

### related_files

- src/run_evaluation_pipeline.sh
- src/judge/judge.py
- src/download_github_folder.sh
- src/rubrics_generator/assess_rubrics.py

### execution

- README now only documents DeepWiki/CodeWiki ingestion and explains that pipelines auto-detect whatever parsed folder exists, with examples for overriding via CLI flags.
- `run_rubrics_pipeline.sh`, `generate_rubrics.py`, `run_evaluation_pipeline.sh`, and `judge/judge.py` all share consistent auto-detection logic (prefer `codewiki`/`deepwiki`, then any folder containing `docs_tree.json`) so users aren't forced to create `original/`.
- `download_github_folder.sh` accepts `--target-subdir` (default `codewiki`) instead of always writing to `original/`, and `assess_rubrics.py` no longer tracks an unused `original` path.
